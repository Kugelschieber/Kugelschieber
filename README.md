### Hi, my name is Marvin!

I'm a full-stack software engineer from Germany, open-source and Linux enthusiast, and co-founder of Emvi, where we build and maintain software projects for clients, and work on existing software.

I’m building [Pirsch Analytics](https://pirsch.io/) — a privacy-friendly, cookie-less web analytics solution made for personal websites, freelancers, and agencies. For more about myself, check out my [website](https://marvinblum.de/).
